Ok, I looking for some beta testers for something I have been writing off and on for a while now. Check out https://dev.mypetsdb.org/. It's intended to be a way for people to keep track of the 'pets' they keep and hopefully give them more info. Right now, don't expect to keep any info you might put into it as I'm still playing with the system and might have to change things up. But it 'should' be ready for people other than me to start poking holes in it (which I'm sure there will be many of).  It should work well on desktops as well as phones/tablets.

I'm currently storing 750k species and 87k common names for basically anything. It's not specific to fish, it's for any organism described in the biological taxonomy. I'm using https://www.itis.gov/ taxonomy data (fish stuff here actually comes from fishbase.org). I poll iucn's red list for info about specific species threat status. I also poll CARES for their threat status data.  I also handle links to 3rd party sites for more detailed info such as seriouslyfish.

There is also varient data loaded for many domestic dogs and cats.  Basically, I can load pretty much any cross reference data.  If you know of some really useful sites that have data specific to some species of organism, let me know and I will talk to them and see about getting access to the data.

Basically, I got tired of tracking info down in various places for the fish I keep...
